  theText: "In my youth, my family encouraged me to vote, this created a ritual of
    voting and it stayed with me my whole life. Back in the old days, most people
    were unable to vote, such as women, prisoners, people who did not own land, etc.
    Now, it\u2019s young people who are still restricted by the system. I want there
    to be no minimum voting age."
